# SokoBot
Full-Fledged Sokoban game with AI using Depth-First, Breadth-First strategies and A* Pathfinding with Manhattan heuristic

So I finally built my sokoban game with an integrated AI for solving it.
I cleared my concepts regarding the traversal techniques and also learned A* algorithm.
This project was a great learning oppurtunity and I had a lot of fun building.
I was being too picky regarding the sprite designs (I redrew the sprites a dozen of times) and was finally satisfied with the final sprite designs. Took inspiration for the sprites from  Count Downula https://gm48.net/game/994/count-downula.

Learn and have fun.
Cheers!
